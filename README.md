Dashboard exploring a sales dataset  and Market Basket Analysis with Power BI.

Data used to this dashboard is "Carbo-loading: A Relational Database" available on [Dunnhumby Site](https://www.dunnhumby.com/source-files/).
This dataset contains 4 tables with information about transactions over a period of two years from four categories: Pasta, Pasta Sauce, Syrup, and Pancake Mix. These categories were chosen so that interactions between the categories can be detected and studied.

This dashboard brings several insights about the dataset. It contains information about the total sales, sales with coupons. Graphics showing the sales values over the years. which products are most sold. Pasta even selling more unities, does not bring the biggest value of sales. The pasta sauce brand Ragu is the most sold even having a major price. It seems that people do not care too much about the pasta, like all the brands are similar in quality, but it seems that they want to invest in buying the pasta sauce of a more expensive brand.

There is a treemap showing the most sold products and brands.
It is also showed in this dashboard a Market Basket Analysis that shows which products are commonly bought together and which products bought together are more profitable. These combinations can be interesting to offers new coupons and promotions.

The interactive dashboard is available on: [PowerBI Online Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/links/RHHyyyVqod?ctid=ede17caf-384e-47f1-8c4e-461181a9e945&pbi_source=linkShare)
